# forkify- First project posted on Github :)

Course derived project based explicitly on pizza, broccoli and bacon. type one of those ingredients and those only-and recipe ideas appear.
Includes ingredients when clicked but no instructions on how to cook them- this is for inspiration only!

Main bits of code are in the src file.

Project is made in a module pattern, it has an Api feature and a webpack coverting Javascript Es6 to Web-browser friendly Javascript.

- Note- special thanks to Jonas Schmedtmann for helpin me on my learning journey.
